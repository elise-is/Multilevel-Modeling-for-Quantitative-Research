# Multilevel-Modeling-for-Quantitative-Research
This is my attempt to solve assignments in my 'Multilevel Modeling for Quantitative Research' class, which is taught by Professor Jeff Gill at Washington University in St. Louis. The syllabus of this course can be found at this URL: https://pages.wustl.edu/jgill/multilevel-modeling
All exercises come from the book 'Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models' (Cambridge University Press 2007) by Gelman and Hill.The data for all the problems can be found at this URL: http://stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/
